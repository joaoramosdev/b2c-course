Effort: Easy
Deadline: 4h
Difficulties/learning points:

ISML templates
Resource.msgf
Find and update .isml template which is responsible for PLP (product list page)
Objective:

Modify the product tile for products that have a sale price to show a custom message (“Best Deal”). Also, calculate the percentage of discount between the standard price and the sale price and display it.

HINTS

Do not hardcode strings in templates. Use Resource Bundles (<name>.properties files and define there your string).

Use the Storefront Toolkit to find out which template to modify
Before writing the logic to calculate the discount, think! Is your customization unique to this context? Will it be reused on other places?
