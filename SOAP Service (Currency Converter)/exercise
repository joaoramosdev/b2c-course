Integrations - SOAP Service (Currency Converter)
Effort: Medium
Deadline: 12h

Objective: 

The goal of this implementation is to help you get familiar with the way SOAP web services are integrated into SFCC by using a simple and straightforward currency converter API: http://www.infovalutar.ro/curs.asmx?wsdl

Additional details about API
The web service provides the value of the RON currency compared to other currencies available out there, e.g. EUR, USD, CAD, etc.

Requirements
Use the currency converter API for displaying on the cart page the total price of a basket in RON. This should be displayed next to the basket total price in the session's currency, e.g. 99.99 EUR / 487.41 RON (assuming a rate of 4.8746 RON for 1 EUR)

Final Result:
